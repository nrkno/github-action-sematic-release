# API reference

## Overview

```
semrel <subcommand> [flags]
```

All subcommands:

- Write structured log messages to **stderr** (`log/slog` text format)
- Reserve **stdout** for data output only (`notes` subcommand)
- Exit **0** for success or no-op
- Exit **1** for expected, user-actionable failures
- Exit **2** for system errors (misconfiguration, shallow clone)

---

## `semrel lint`

Validates that every commit in the relevant range conforms to
[Conventional Commits 1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

Before applying rules, `semrel lint` looks for a `.semrelrc.yml` file in the
working directory and uses it to override default rule settings. See
[Configuration — Lint configuration file](/docs/configuration.md#lint-configuration-file-semrelrcyml)
for the full schema and available rules.

`commit-types.allowed-types` (when non-empty) fully replaces the built-in commit
type set; only the listed types will pass lint. Use `commit-types.extra-types` to
add types on top of the built-in set without replacing it.

### Synopsis

```
semrel lint [--from-ref <ref>] [--to-ref <ref>]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--from-ref` | string | auto | Range start. On `pull_request`: `GITHUB_BASE_REF`. On `push`/`release`: latest annotated tag. On other events: beginning of history. |
| `--to-ref` | string | `HEAD` | Range end. |

### Automatic range detection

| `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME` | Default `--from-ref` | Default `--to-ref` |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| `pull_request` | `GITHUB_BASE_REF` (target branch) | `HEAD` |
| `push` | latest annotated tag | `HEAD` |
| `release` | latest annotated tag | `HEAD` |
| *(other / empty)* | beginning of history | `HEAD` |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0` | All commits in range are valid conventional commits. |
| `1` | One or more commits violated the conventional commit format, **or** the `.semrelrc.yml` config file is present but malformed. Violations are printed to stderr, one per commit: `commit <short-sha>: <rule>\n  <raw message>\n  example: <example>`. |
| `2` | System error (e.g., shallow repository, git operation failed). |

### Stdout

Nothing. Lint output goes to stderr.

### Stderr

On violation (exit 1), one block per offending commit:

```
commit abc1234: missing type
  wip stuff
  example: fix: correct handling of empty input
```

---

## `semrel release`

Computes the next semantic version from conventional commits, creates an annotated
git tag, pushes it, and creates a GitHub Release.

`release-branches` (`.semrelrc.yml`) gates execution: if the current branch does
not match any listed pattern, `semrel release` exits 0 without creating a release.
`bump-rules` controls which commit types trigger a version bump and at which level.
`tag-prefix` controls the string prepended to the version number in git tags (default `"v"`).

### Synopsis

```
semrel release [--dry-run]
```

### Flags

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--dry-run` | bool | `false` | Compute version and write `GITHUB_OUTPUT` fields without creating the tag, pushing, or calling the GitHub Releases API. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0` | Release created, or no release needed (no releasable commits), or release already existed (idempotent re-run). All `GITHUB_OUTPUT` fields are written in all `0` cases. |
| `1` | Tag conflict: the computed tag already exists but points to a different commit SHA. This indicates a concurrent release run computed the same version. Re-run the workflow or investigate the tag. |
| `2` | System error: shallow repository, missing `GITHUB_TOKEN`, invalid `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` format, or git operation failed. |

### GITHUB_OUTPUT fields

Written on exit 0 in all cases (released or not):

| Field | Example | Notes |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| `released` | `true` / `false` | `false` when no releasable commits were found. |
| `version` | `1.2.3` | Current version (without `v`). Always set. |
| `tag` | `v1.2.3` | Current tag. Always set. |
| `major` | `1` | Major component. Always set. |
| `minor` | `2` | Minor component. Always set. |
| `patch` | `3` | Patch component. Always set. |

### Stdout

Nothing. Log messages go to stderr.

### Log output

`semrel release` emits the following structured `slog.Info` lines to stderr, providing a
narrative of the release in GitHub Actions logs:

| When | Key | Description |
| ---- | --- | ----------- |
| After parsing commits | `msg=commits in release` | `count` total parsed commits, `feat` feature count, `fix` fix count, `breaking` breaking-change count. |
| Bootstrap path only (no prior tags) | `msg=no prior annotated tags found — bootstrapping version` | `version` — the computed bootstrap tag (e.g. `v0.0.1`). |
| After version computed | `msg=bump detected` | `type` (`major`/`minor`/`patch`/`none`), `from` previous tag, `to` next tag. |
| Once per commit with an associated PR | `msg=PR in release` | `pr` (`#N`), `title`, `sha` (7-char). |
| After identifying the highest-bump commit | `msg=release triggered by PR` | `pr` (`#N`), `title`, `url`. Falls back to `msg=release triggered by commit` with `sha` and `message` if no PR is found. |
| After local annotated tag created (Rung 3) | `msg=created annotated tag` | `tag` name, `commit` 7-char SHA. |
| After tag pushed to origin (Rung 3) | `msg=pushed tag to origin` | `tag` name. |
| After GitHub Release created (Rung 2 or 3) | `msg=created GitHub release` | `tag` name, `url` GitHub Release HTML URL. |

### Idempotency

`release` is safe to re-run. See [Architecture — Idempotency ladder](/docs/architecture.md)
for the three-rung precedence logic.

---

## `semrel notify`

Posts a deduplicated comment on every merged PR that is included in a published
GitHub Release. It is designed to run in a **separate `notify.yml` workflow**
triggered by `on: release: types: [published]`, not as a job inside the release
pipeline.

### Trigger

```yaml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

### Synopsis

```
semrel notify
```

### Flags

None.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `SEMREL_TAG` | **Yes** | Full tag name of the published release (e.g. `v1.3.0`). Set from `${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}`. When absent, `notify` exits 0 as a no-op. |
| `SEMREL_RELEASE_URL` | No | HTML URL of the published GitHub Release. Constructed from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL/GITHUB_REPOSITORY/releases/tag/SEMREL_TAG` if absent. |
| `SEMREL_VERSION` | No | Version string without the `v` prefix. Used for display purposes only. |

### What it does

1. Reads `SEMREL_TAG` to identify the released tag.
2. Finds the previous annotated tag in the repository.
3. Enumerates all commits between the previous tag and the released tag.
4. For each commit, looks up associated PRs via the GitHub API.
5. Deduplicates the PR list across all commits.
6. Posts an idempotent comment on each unique PR.

### Skip conditions

- `SEMREL_TAG` not set or empty → exits 0 (no-op).
- Released tag not found in the repository → exits 1 (error).
- Comment marker `<!-- semrel-notify:<tag> -->` already exists on a PR → skips
  that PR only (idempotent per-PR guard).

### Marker format

Comments posted by `notify` contain an HTML marker on the first line:

```
<!-- semrel-notify:v1.3.0 -->
🎉 This pull request has been included in release [v1.3.0](https://github.com/owner/repo/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
```

The marker is used to detect and skip duplicate posts. It is not visible when the
comment is rendered. The marker uses the full tag name (e.g. `v1.3.0`).

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0` | Comments posted, or no-op (`SEMREL_TAG` not set). |
| `1` | Released tag not found in repository, or GitHub API error. |

### Stdout

Nothing. Log messages go to stderr.

---

## `semrel notes`

Generates Markdown release notes from conventional commits since the last annotated
tag and linked PRs.

### Synopsis

```
semrel notes
```

### Flags

None.

### Output format

Release notes are written to **stdout** in Markdown:

```markdown
## What's Changed

### Features
- feat: add retry logic for API calls (abc1234) (#42)

### Bug Fixes
- fix: handle empty commit range correctly (def5678) (#43)

### Other Changes
- chore: update dependencies (ghi9012)
```

Commits are grouped by type. PR links are resolved via the GitHub API
(`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/pulls`) with a fallback to search.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `0` | Notes written to stdout (and to `GITHUB_OUTPUT` `notes` field if `GITHUB_OUTPUT` is set). |
| `1` | System error: git operation, GitHub API call, or output write failed. |

### GITHUB_OUTPUT fields

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `notes` | Full Markdown notes body (only written if `GITHUB_OUTPUT` is set). |

---

## Using as a GitHub Action

semrel ships as a prebuilt Docker image on GHCR and can be consumed directly
from `action.yml` without any local Go toolchain.

### Minimal workflow

```yaml
# Pin to a specific commit SHA (see Releases for the SHA of each release)
- uses: nrkno/github-action-sematic-release@COMMIT_SHA_HERE
  id: semrel
  with:
    subcommand: release
  # token defaults to ${{ github.token }} — no explicit input needed
```

### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `subcommand` | **yes** | — | Subcommand to run: `lint`, `release`, `notify`, or `notes`. |
| `token` | no | `${{ github.token }}` | GitHub token for API calls and git push. |
| `dry-run` | no | `"false"` | Set to `"true"` to skip tag creation, push, and release creation. |
| `working-directory` | no | `.` | Path to the git repository root inside the runner workspace. |

### Outputs

| Output | Example | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| `released` | `true` / `false` | Whether a new release was created. |
| `version` | `1.2.3` | Version string without the `v` prefix. |
| `tag` | `v1.2.3` | Git tag name. |
| `major_version` | `1` | Major component. |
| `minor_version` | `2` | Minor component. |
| `patch_version` | `3` | Patch component. |
| `bump` | `minor` | Bump type: `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or `none`. |
| `notes` | *(markdown)* | Rendered release notes (set by the `notes` subcommand). |
| `sha` | `abc1234…` | HEAD commit SHA at the time of the release. |

### Permissions

The workflow job that calls `release` must have:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write   # create annotated tags and GitHub Releases
```

The `notify.yml` workflow job must have:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write  # post PR comments
```

### Example: release workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: nrkno/github-action-sematic-release@COMMIT_SHA_HERE
        with:
          subcommand: lint

  release:
    needs: lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    outputs:
      released: ${{ steps.semrel.outputs.released }}
      version:  ${{ steps.semrel.outputs.version }}
      tag:      ${{ steps.semrel.outputs.tag }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: nrkno/github-action-sematic-release@COMMIT_SHA_HERE
        id: semrel
        with:
          subcommand: release
```

### Example: notify workflow (separate file)

`notify` runs in a dedicated workflow triggered by the `release` event so it has
access to `github.event.release.tag_name` and `github.event.release.html_url`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/notify.yml
name: Notify PRs
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          fetch-tags: true
      - uses: nrkno/github-action-sematic-release@COMMIT_SHA_HERE
        with:
          subcommand: notify
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        env:
          SEMREL_TAG: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
          SEMREL_VERSION: ${{ github.event.release.name }}
          SEMREL_RELEASE_URL: ${{ github.event.release.html_url }}
```
