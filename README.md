**semrel** is NRK's in-house semantic-release CLI — a single Go binary that enforces
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), computes the next semver,
creates GitHub Releases, and notifies merged PRs. It replaces the supply-chain-compromised
`codfish/semantic-release` Action.

The container image is published to GHCR and signed with
[cosign keyless](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/) on every release.

## Security

> ⚠️ **Always pin by commit SHA, not tag.**

Git tags are mutable. An attacker with push access to this repository could
force-push a tag to a malicious commit. Pinning by commit SHA gives you an
immutable reference that cannot be silently changed.

```yaml
# ✅ Secure — commit SHA is immutable
- uses: nrkno/github-action-sematic-release@<COMMIT_SHA>
  with:
    subcommand: release
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# ⚠️ Less secure — git tags can be force-pushed
- uses: nrkno/github-action-sematic-release@v1.2.3
  with:
    subcommand: release
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The action image is also pinned by digest (`sha256:…`) inside `action.yml`,
which protects against the container registry tag being overwritten. Together,
SHA pinning (git layer) + digest pinning (container layer) gives full
supply-chain protection.

Each release prints its commit SHA in the workflow summary. You can also find
it on the [releases page](https://github.com/nrkno/github-action-sematic-release/releases).

## Quick start

The minimal release workflow — drop this in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0        # ⚠️  required — see warning below
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.25'
      - run: go build -o semrel github.com/nrkno/semrel/cmd/semrel
      - id: semrel
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: ./semrel release
```

> **⚠️ `fetch-depth: 0` is required.**
> semrel reads the full commit and tag history to determine the previous version and build
> the commit range. A shallow clone (`fetch-depth: 1`, the GitHub Actions default) causes
> semrel to exit with code `2` (system error). Always set `fetch-depth: 0`.
