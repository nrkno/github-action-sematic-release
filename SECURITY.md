# Security policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version of semrel is actively supported. Security fixes
are released as patch versions following Semantic Versioning.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report vulnerabilities by sending a private security advisory via

or by emailing **security@nrk.no**.

Include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact

- Affected version(s)
- Any suggested mitigation

We will acknowledge your report within **3 business days** and aim to release a

## Disclosure policy

We follow coordinated disclosure. Please allow us reasonable time to release a
fix before any public disclosure. We will credit reporters in the release notes
unless anonymity is requested.

## Supply-chain attestations

Container images are signed with [cosign keyless](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/signing/overview/)
on every release. Verify an image signature:

```bash
