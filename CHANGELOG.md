## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- `semrel` Go CLI binary with four subcommands: `lint`, `release`, `notify`, `notes`
- `lint` — validates conventional commits in the range relevant to the current GitHub Actions event (PR base → HEAD, or previous tag → HEAD on push)
- `release` — computes next semver from conventional commit bump signals, creates an annotated git tag, pushes it, and creates a GitHub Release; idempotency ladder guards against double-releases
- `notify` — posts a deduplicated `<!-- semrel-notify:<version> -->` comment on the merged PR after a successful release
- `notes` — generates Markdown release notes from conventional commits and linked PRs, suitable for step summary output
- Distroless container image (`gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot`) published to GHCR with cosign keyless signing
- Multi-architecture image build (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- CI workflow: unit tests, race detector, integration tests, golangci-lint, conventional commit lint
- Release workflow: build-from-source (no bootstrap dependency on the container), publish image, notify

### Security

- Replaces the compromised third-party `codfish/semantic-release` GitHub Action
- Uses only `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no external secrets required
- Container signed with cosign keyless (Sigstore) for supply-chain attestation
